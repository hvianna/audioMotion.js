#EXTM3U
#
# This is an example of m3u playlist using the Extended M3U format directives.
# For format reference, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U#Extended_M3U
#
# Notes:
#
# * Any metadata found in the media files will have precedence over the
#   content added here;
#
# * Only EXTALB and EXTINF directives are currently supported;
#
# * Contents of EXTALB will be applied to all songs that come after it, so
#   no need to repeat the directive for consecutive songs in the same album;
#
# * Filenames may include folders, but all paths must be relative to the
#   location of the .m3u file (no initial slash or drive letter).
