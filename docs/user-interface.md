## Source and Speakers

![ui-source](img/UI_source.png)

Move the Source switch to the **MIC** position to visualize audio from your microphone instead of the music player.
When MIC is selected, the Speakers are automatically turned off to prevent feedback loops from the speakers.
If you're using headphones you can safely turn the Speakers on to listen to the microphone audio.

> Please note that microphone access is only allowed in a secure context, i.e., if you're accessing audioMotion on *localhost*, via local file (open index.html file) or HTTPS protocol.

If your sound card supports *Stereo mix* mode, this option may be listed as an input device when you set the Source to MIC.
The *Stereo mix* input allows audioMotion to read audio generated by any program running in your PC.

## Settings Panel

### Mode

<div class="settings-panel highlight-mode"></div>

Selects the visualization mode.

| Mode | description |
|------|-------------|
**Discrete frequencies** | displays amplitudes of individual frequencies, as provided by the [FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) computation
**Area graph** | uses the discrete frequency data points to create a filled area graph
**Line graph** | connects all the discrete data points in a continuous line graph - [line width and fill opacity](#line-width-and-fill-opacity) can be customized
**Octave bands** | groups frequencies in bands, each one representing a full, half or the *n*th part of an octave, depending on the selected option

You can also select the visualization mode using the **M** and **Shift + M** keyboard shortcuts.

### Random Mode

<div class="settings-panel highlight-random-mode"></div>

The visualization mode and [several other settings](#settings-affected-by-random-mode) may be randomized on track change or time interval.

If the [AUTO](#gradient) Gradient switch is active, a random gradient will be selected on every mode change.

You can choose which settings may be changed by random mode in the [Config panel](#config-panel).

### Bar spacing

<div class="settings-panel highlight-bar-spacing"></div>

This setting is effective only when an [octave bands mode](#mode) is selected. Avaliable options are:

| Bar Spacing | description |
|-------------|-------------|
**Legacy** | ~1px spacing between analyzer bars
**Narrow** | 10% spacing, 90% bar width (default)
**Regular** | 25% spacing, 75% bar width
**Wide** | 50% spacing, 50% bar width
**Extra wide** | 75% spacing, 25% bar width

### Line Width and Fill Opacity

<div class="settings-panel highlight-line-width-fill-opacity"></div>

These settings are effective only for [Line graph mode](#mode) or when [OUTLINE](#effects) effect is on.

**Line Width** controls the thickness of the graph line or bar stroke.

**Fill Opacity** adjusts the transparency of the graph area or bar fill. The [ALPHA](#effects) effect, when active, has precedence over the Fill Opacity (for octave bands modes only).

⚠ On **Firefox**, Fill Opacity may not work properly with [Radial](#radial) analyzer, due to [this bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1164912).

### Gradient

<div class="settings-panel highlight-gradient"></div>

Several options of color gradients for the analyzer graphs. You can also change gradients using the **G** and **Shift + G** keyboard shortcuts.

| Switch | description |
|:-------|:------------|
| **AUTO** | select the **next gradient** on each track change, or a **random gradient** on each mode change when [Random mode](#random-mode) is active |
| **SPLIT** | when [Stereo](#switches) is active, splits the gradient between both channels, so each channel will have different colors |

### Effects

<div class="settings-panel highlight-effects"></div>

Select additional visualization effects for **octave bands modes.**

| Effect | description | example (on) |
|:-------|:------------|:------------:|
| **LEDS** | toggle the vintage LED effect for the analyzer bars | <img src="img/leds.png" width="480">
| **LUMI** | toggle the luminance bars effect - all analyzer bars are displayed at full-height, varying their luminance instead | <img src="img/screenshot5.png" width="480">
| **ALPHA** | toggle varying bar transparency - the higher the bar amplitude the more opaque it is (also works on *Discrete frequencies* mode) | <img src="img/alpha-on-off.webp" width="480">
| **OUTLINE** | toggle bar outline mode - see [Line width and Fill opacity](#line-width-and-fill-opacity) settings | <img src="img/outline.png" width="480">

### Radial

<div class="settings-panel highlight-radial"></div>

If the **RADIAL** switch is on, the spectrum analyzer is displayed as a circle with radial frequencies. **This mode disables both LEDS and LUMI effects.**

You can also toggle the radial analyzer with the **C** keyboard shortcut.

The **SPIN** slider allows you to configure the analyzer spinning speed, when in radial mode.

| Radial Mono | Radial Stereo |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| ![screenshot7](img/screenshot7.png) | ![radial-stereo](img/radial-stereo.png)

### Background

<div class="settings-panel highlight-background"></div>

Selects the analyzer background.

| Background | description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Gradient default** | uses the background color defined by the currently selected gradient - when the [LED effect](#effects) is on, this shows the "unlit" LEDs instead |
| **Black** | uses a black background |
| **Album cover** | displays the album cover for the current song<sup> (1)</sup> |
| **Random image** | selects a random image from the backgrounds folder<sup> (2)</sup> |
| **Random video** | selects a random video from the backgrounds folder<sup> (2)</sup> |

<sup>**( 1 )**</sup> Album covers will be preferably retrieved from song metadata. When a picture is not found in the metadata, **audioMotion** will look for image files (jpg, png, gif, webp, avif or bmp)
in the song's folder, and will pick any image which filename contains the words *cover*, *folder* or *front* (in this order), or the first image found otherwise.

<sup>**( 2 )**</sup> If you use the `-b` option when [starting **audioMotion**](/#getting-started), image and video files in the provided folder
can also be used as background. All media files found in the first level folder (no subfolders) can be selected by the *Random image* or *Random video* options,
and the first 20 files will also be directly available in the selection box.

See also [BG Image Fit](#background-image-fit) and [Background Dim](#background-dim) settings for additional options for background images and videos.

You can cycle through the available options using the **B** keyboard shortcut.

### Background Image Fit

<div class="settings-panel highlight-bgimagefit"></div>

When [Background](#background) is set to **Album cover** or an image, this option selects the size and positioning of the background image.

| BG Image Fit | Effect |
|--------------|-------------|
**Adjust** | Resizes the image so it fills the entire canvas
**Center** | Displays the image horizontally centered on the canvas (default)
**Pulse** | Makes the image pulsate to the beat of the song
**Repeat** | Repeats the image horizontally to fill the canvas
**Warp** | Applies a 3D "warp" effect to the background image
**Warp Drive** | Animated *Warp* effect
**Wormhole** | *Warp Drive* effect with additional rotation
**Zoom In** | Image is initially centered on the canvas and slowly zooms in as the song plays
**Zoom Out** | Image is initially enlarged at 200% and slowly zooms out as the song plays

You can cycle through the available options using the **Shift + B** keyboard shortcut.

⚠ The **Warp Drive** and **Wormhole** effects may be slow on some browsers or graphics cards.

Undesired options can be disabled in the [Config panel](#config-panel).

### Background Dim

<div class="settings-panel highlight-background-dim"></div>

When [Background](#background) is set to an image (including the Album cover) or video, this option adjusts the brightness of the background.

### Reflex and Mirror

<div class="settings-panel highlight-reflex-mirror"></div>

**Reflex** selects the vertical reflection style for the analyzer. This setting has no effect when the [LUMI](#effects) switch is active.

**Mirror** selects the horizontal mirroring effect to the left (low frequencies at the center) or to the right (high frequencies at the center).

| Reflex On | Reflex Mirrored |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| ![reflex-on](img/reflex-on.png) | ![reflex-mirrored](img/reflex-mirrored.png)

| Mirror Left | Mirror Right |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| ![mirror-left](img/mirror-left.png) | ![mirror-right](img/mirror-right.png)

### Sensitivity

<div class="settings-panel highlight-sensitivity"></div>

Adjusts the analyzer sensitivity to improve the visualization of songs too quiet or too loud. You can also use the **N** and **Shift + N** keyboard shortcuts.

There are three presets (low, normal and high) that can be customized in the [Config panel](#config-panel).

### Frequency Range

<div class="settings-panel highlight-frequency-range"></div>

The lowest and highest frequencies represented in the spectrum analyzer. You can use this feature to "zoom in" a specific frequency range.

### Smoothing

<div class="settings-panel highlight-smoothing"></div>

Averaging factor used to smooth values between analysis frames.

Lower values make the analyzer react faster to changes, and may look better with faster tempo songs and/or larger [FFT sizes](#general-settings).
Increase it if the analyzer animation looks too "jumpy".

### Fullscreen Height

<div class="settings-panel highlight-fsheight"></div>

Adjusts the height of the analyzer when in fullscreen. This can be used to provide a wider look to the analyzer.

You can also use the **Shift** + **Up** and **Down** arrows to adjust the analyzer height during fullscreen.

### Switches

<div class="settings-panel highlight-switches"></div>

| switch | action |
|:-------|:-------|
| **SCALEX** | show frequency (Hz) scale on the horizontal axis |
| **SCALEY** | show level (dB) scale on the vertical axis |
| **INFO** | toggle on-screen display of song information on every track change |
| **PEAKS** | show amplitude peaks for each frequency |
| **FLAT** | toggle outline (on) or shadow (off) for text messages displayed on canvas - may improve performance, depending on your graphics card and browser |
| **LO-RES** | reduce canvas resolution to improve rendering speed (especially useful for 4K+ displays) |
| **STEREO** | toggle dual channel display, with separate analyzer graphs for left and right channels. This setting does NOT change the audio output of stereo songs. |
| **FPS** | show current framerate at the top right corner |

![screenshot3](img/screenshot3.png)
*Fullscreen view: 1/6th-octave bands, regular bar spacing, "Outrun" gradient, [Reflex](user-interface.md#reflex) effect and complete on-screen information.*

![screenshot6](img/screenshot6.png)
*Fullscreen view: [Stereo](#switches) Line graph, frequency and level scales on, "Rainbow" gradient.*

### Preset

<div class="settings-panel highlight-preset"></div>

The **Demo** preset will pick new visualization settings when loaded and will set random mode to 15 seconds, so it's a great way to quickly overview all of audioMotion's features!

**Full resolution**, **LED bars** and **Octave bands** presets provide quick configuration recommendations.

Any changes to the settings will be automatically saved to your browser's [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
and restored the next time you open audioMotion. You can manually load the **Last session** preset to undo any changes made during the current session.

The **Restore defaults** preset resets all options to their initial values, as in the first time you run audioMotion.

Save a favorite configuration in the **Custom** preset, by clicking the **Save** button.


## Console

![console](img/console.png)

The console records several useful information, like audio and video settings, configuration changes and error messages.


## Config Panel

![config-panel](img/config-panel.png)

### Enabled Modes

Uncheck the visualization modes you don't want to appear in the [Mode](#mode) selection box.

### Enabled Gradients

Uncheck the gradients you don't want to appear in the [Gradient](#gradient) selection box.

### Enabled BG Image Fit options

Uncheck the options you don't want to appear in the [BG Image Fit](#background-image-fit) selection box.

### Settings affected by Random Mode

Customize which configuration settings may be changed when the visualization mode is randomized (see [Random Mode](#random-mode)).

Please note that the Gradient will be randomized on each change if the [AUTO](#gradient) switch is on.

Disabled modes, gradients and image fit options will also be excluded from the randomization.

### General settings

**FFT Size** is the number of samples used for the [Fast Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) performed by the analyzer.

Higher values provide greater detail in the frequency domain (especially for low frequencies), but less detail in the time domain (slower response to changes).
The default value of **8192** usually provides the best cost/benefit ratio for both domains.

**PIP window aspect ratio** selects the aspect ratio of the Picture-In-Picture window.
After entering PIP, the window can be resized and the selected aspect ratio will be preserved.

### Sensitivity presets

Customize low, normal and high sensitivity presets (see [Sensitivity](#sensitivity) setting). **0** dB represents the loudest possible sound volume.

### On-screen information display options

Customize how long song information is displayed on screen, on different events, and toggle display of albums covers and track count.
