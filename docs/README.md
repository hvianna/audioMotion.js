## About

![audioMotion-header](img/audioMotion-header.png)

> **audioMotion** is a media player and high-resolution real-time audio spectrum analyzer that allows you to **SEE your music!** â™ªâ™«ðŸ¤©<br>
> It is completely free, open-source software, created out of my passion for the graphic spectrum analyzers of hi-fi systems from the 1980s.
