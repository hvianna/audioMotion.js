### Source selection

Toggles between using the app's own media player or your microphone as the audio source for the analyzer.

If your sound card and operating system support *Stereo mix* mode, it should also appear as an input device option when you set the Source to **MIC.**<br>
*Stereo mix* allows audioMotion to receive audio generated by any program running in your PC.

?> When Source is set to **MIC**, output to the speakers is automatically turned off to prevent feedback loop. (See [Speakers and Volume](#speakers-and-volume))

### Player controls

These are your standard media control buttons.

| button | action |
|:------:|:-------|
| ![ui-player-play-pause](img/UI_player_play_pause.png "play / pause") | Play / pause |
| ![ui-player-previous](img/UI_player_previous.png "previous") | Previous track - Hold to rewind |
| ![ui-player-stop](img/UI_player_stop.png "stop") | Stop playback and reset the queue pointer to the first song |
| ![ui-player-next](img/UI_player_next.png "next") | Next track - Hold to fast forward |
| ![ui-player-shuffle](img/UI_player_shuffle.png "shuffle") | Shuffle queue and start playback |
| ![ui-player-repeat](img/UI_player_repeat.png "repeat") | Toggle queue repeat |

Below the player controls you'll find the current track's elapsed time, progress bar and remaining time.

![player-controls-and-progress-bar](img/player-controls-and-progress-bar.png)

You can drag the progress bar cursor to fast forward or rewind, or click anywhere on the bar to quickly jump to the relative position on the track.

### Speakers and Volume

<img src="img/UI_source.png" class="img-right">

The **Speakers** switch enables or disables audio output to speakers (or headphones) connected to your device.

When [Source](#source-selection) is switched to MIC, Speakers are automatically turned off to prevent audio feedback loop.
If you're using headphones you can safely turn it on, in order to hear the input audio.

*Actual codec support may vary, depending on browser and operating system.*

### File Explorer

The **File Explorer** allows you to navigate through your media folders and files.

!> Access to your device is provided to the app by the [File System Access API](https://caniuse.com/native-filesystem-api),
which is currently **only implemented on Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Chrome, Opera and Edge).
On **Brave browser** it needs to be enabled in `chrome://flags/#file-system-access-api`.

**Double-click** a file to quickly add it to the play queue. It will also start playing if the player is currently stopped.

Hold **Ctrl** and click to select multiple files, or **Shift** + click to select a range of files.

You can then **drag and drop** the selected files into the play queue, or use the action buttons:

| button | action |
|:------:|:-------|
**Switch to<br>Server / Device** | Switches between browsing folders on your local device or the songs hosted on the app server
**Add selected**  | Add currently selected files in the file explorer to the play queue
**Add all files** | Add all files in the current folder to the play queue
**Add from URL**  | Load a remote audio file or stream from an URL
**Open file**     | Open and play a single media file from your device<br>*(Only displayed on browsers with no support for the File System Access API)*

?> The first image found in the current folder will be shown in the background of the file explorer, with precedence given to filenames containing the words *cover*,
*folder* or *front* (in this order).

### Play queue and saved playlists

**Double-click** a queued song to play it.

Drag and drop songs to reorder them inside the queue. Hold **Ctrl** and click to select multiple files, or **Shift** + click to select a range.
Press **Delete** (*Backspace* on Mac) to remove selected songs from the queue.

Click the **Clear** button to clear the play queue.

The contents of the play queue are automatically restored the next time you open audioMotion. You can disable this feature in [Config - General settings](#general-settings).

**You can also save the play queue to internal named playlists for quick access.**

Saved playlists appear in the playlist selection box, as shown below:

![internal-playlists](img/internal-playlists.png)

Create and manage your playlists using the following buttons:

| Button | Action |
|:-------|:-------|
**Save as...** | Saves the current queue contents to a new playlist
**Save**       | **Update the selected playlist** with the current queue contents
**Load**       | Load the selected playlist, **adding** its contents to the end of the current queue
**Delete**     | Permanently delete the selected playlist

!> Saved playlists are stored in the browser's internal storage and will only be accessible in the same browser they were saved.

### Playlist files

The File Explorer can load playlist files in M3U format (*.m3u* or *.m3u8* extensions), which are basically text files with one filename per line.

The [Extended M3U format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U#Extended_M3U)'s `#EXTINF` and `#EXTALB` directives are also supported,
and allow adding artist names, album and song titles for media files that don't have embedded metadada.

Playlist entries may include folder names, including `..` to access upper-level folders, but **all paths must be relative to the location of the .m3u file itself,**
i.e., paths **must not** start with a slash or drive letter.

Playlists can also include remote media files and streams, using **https://** protocol.

Example of an .m3u file:

```
#EXTM3U
#
# See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U#Extended_M3U for format reference.
#
# Note: EXTALB is applied to all songs that come after it, no need to repeat it.
#
#EXTALB:Animals (1977)
#EXTINF:84,Pink Floyd - Pigs on the Wing. Part 1
track01.mp3
#EXTINF:1025,Pink Floyd - Dogs
track02.mp3
#EXTINF:686,Pink Floyd - Pigs (Three Different Ones)
track03.mp3
#EXTINF:619,Pink Floyd - Sheep
track04.mp3
#EXTINF:85,Pink Floyd - Pigs on the Wing. Part 2
track05.mp3
```

### Subtitles

**audioMotion** can display subtitles in WebVTT format (.vtt), for video and audio files.

![screenshot4](img/screenshot4.jpg)

**Subtitle files must be in the same folder and have the same base name of its corresponding media file, with a lowercase .vtt extension.**

Media files with detected subtitles will show a **[SUBS]** badge next to their names in the File Explorer, as shown below:

![file-explorer-subs](img/file-explorer-subs.png)

Configure the subtitles appearance in **[Config - Subtitles configuration](#subtitles-configuration).** Toggle the display of subtitles with the [**SUBTITLES** switch](#switches).

?> Download synced lyrics for your songs with [LRCGET](https://github.com/tranxuanthang/lrcget) and use [Subtitle Edit](https://github.com/SubtitleEdit/subtitleedit)
to convert them (and other popular subtitle formats) to .vtt.

## Settings Panel

Click **Settings** in the top panel buttons to open the Settings Panel.

![ui-buttons-settings](img/UI_main_buttons_settings.png)

### Load and Save Presets

<div class="settings-panel highlight-preset"></div>

Click the **Load** button to load a preset.

**audioMotion comes with 6 built-in presets that showcase different features of the analyzer, plus 9 slots for user-defined presets.**

The **Demo** preset will choose random visualization settings when loaded and will set [**Randomize**](#randomize) to 15 seconds, so it's a great way to quickly overview all of audioMotion's features!

You can also quickly pick random settings anytime, by pressing **0** in the keyboard.

Your last configuration will be automatically restored the next time you open audioMotion.
You can manually load the **Last session** preset to undo any changes made during the current session.

The **Restore defaults** preset resets all analyzer settings to their initial values, as in the first time you run audioMotion.

Click the **Save / Edit** button to save, update or delete a favorite configuration in one of the **user preset slots.**

The current settings can also be saved to a user slot by holding **Shift** and pressing the numbers **1** to **9** in the keyboard.

Quickly load a user preset by pressing the corresponding slot number in the keyboard (**1** to **9**).

!> User presets are saved to the browser's storage and will only be accessible in the same browser they were saved.

### Randomize

<div class="settings-panel highlight-randomize"></div>

Selects random visualization settings on track change or time interval.

You can choose which settings may be changed by Randomize in [Config - Randomize configuration](#randomize-configuration).

### Bar spacing

<div class="settings-panel highlight-bar-spacing"></div>

This setting is effective only when an [octave bands mode](#analyzer-mode) is selected. Avaliable options are:

| Bar Spacing | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
**MIN** | ~1px spacing between analyzer bars
**10**  | 10% spacing, 90% bar width (default)
**25**  | 25% spacing, 75% bar width
**50**  | 50% spacing, 50% bar width
**75**  | 75% spacing, 25% bar width

### Line Width and Fill Opacity

<div class="settings-panel highlight-line-width-fill-opacity"></div>

These settings are effective only for [Line graph mode](#analyzer-mode) or when [OUTLINE](#switches) switch is on.

**Line Width** controls the thickness of the graph line or outline stroke.

**Fill Opacity** adjusts the transparency of the graph area or bar fill. The [ALPHA](#switches) switch, when active, has precedence over the Fill Opacity (for octave bands modes only).

!> On **Firefox**, Fill Opacity may not work properly with [Radial](#switches) analyzer, due to [this bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1164912).

### Analyzer Mode

<div class="settings-panel highlight-mode"></div>

Selects the visualization mode.

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Discrete frequencies** | Displays amplitudes of individual frequencies, as provided by the [FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) computation
| **Area graph** | Uses the discrete frequency data points to create a filled area graph
| **Line graph** | Connects all the discrete data points in a continuous line graph - [line width and fill opacity](#line-width-and-fill-opacity) can be customized
| **Bands** | Frequencies are grouped in bands. When [Frequency Scale](#frequency-scale) is set to **LOG**, each bar represents the *n*th part of an octave

You can also select the visualization mode using the **M** and **Shift + M** keyboard shortcuts.

### Gradients

<div class="settings-panel highlight-gradients"></div>

Select the color gradients used for the analyzer graphs. You can also change gradients using the **G** and **Shift + G** keyboard shortcuts.

You can disable specific gradients and **create your own gradients** in [Config - Add Gradient](#enabled-gradients).

The **LINK** and **SPLIT** switches control some specific features when using a dual [Channel Layout](#channel-layout):

| Switch    | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| **LINK**  | Uses the same gradient for both analyzer channels.
| **SPLIT** | Splits the gradient between both channels (**VERT** [channel layout](#channel-layout) only), so each channel will use different colors.

### Color Mode

<div class="settings-panel highlight-color-mode"></div>

Selects the desired mode for coloring the analyzer bars. This property has no effect in **Area Graph** and **Line Graph** [modes](#analyzer-mode).

| Color Mode | Description | Preview ('prism' gradient)
|------------|-------------|----------------------------
| GRADIENT   | Analyzer bars are painted with the currently selected [Gradients](#gradients). | ![prism](img/gradient-prism.png)
| INDEX      | Each analyzer bar is painted with a **single color** from the selected gradients, starting with the first color applied to the first bar, and so on, cycling through the available colors. | ![prism-bar-index](img/gradient-prism-bar-index.png)
| LEVEL      | Colors from the selected gradient are used to paint each bar, according to its current level (amplitude). | ![prism-bar-level](img/gradient-prism-bar-level.png)

### Radial Spin

<div class="settings-panel highlight-radial-spin"></div>

Configure the radial analyzer spinning speed, when [RADIAL](#switches) switch is on.


### Background

<div class="settings-panel highlight-background"></div>

Selects the analyzer background.

| Background | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Gradient default** | Uses the background color defined by the currently selected gradient - when the [LED switch](#switches) is on, this shows the "unlit" LEDs instead |
| **Black** | Uses a black background |
| **Album cover** | Displays the album cover for the current song<sup> (1)</sup> |
| **Random image** | Selects a random image from the backgrounds folder<sup> (2)</sup> |
| **Random video** | Selects a random video from the backgrounds folder<sup> (2)</sup> |

<sup>**( 1 )**</sup> Album covers will be preferably retrieved from the file's metadata. When a picture is not found in the metadata, **audioMotion** will look for image files
in the song's folder, and will pick any image which filename contains the words *cover*, *folder* or *front* (in this order), or the first image found otherwise.

<sup>**( 2 )**</sup> The web app includes a few built-in background images and videos. **You can select your own backgrounds folder in [Config - General settings](#background-media-source).**
You can also customize [how many files will be directly available](#background-media-max-items) in the selection box, but for large amounts of files use the *Random image* and *Random video* options to randomly choose among **all** files found in the backgrounds folder.

See also [Background Image Fit](#background-image-fit) and [Background Dim](#background-dim) settings for additional options for background images and videos.

You can cycle through the available options using the **B** keyboard shortcut.

?> **When a video file is loaded on the player** the Background setting has no effect, but you can still adjust the [Background Dim](#background-dim).

### Background Image Fit

<div class="settings-panel highlight-bgimagefit"></div>

When [Background](#background) is set to **Album cover** or an image, this option selects the size and positioning of the background image.

| Background Image Fit | Effect |
|----------------------|--------|
**Adjust** | Resizes the image so it fills the entire canvas
**Center** | Displays the image horizontally centered on the canvas (default)
**Pulse** | Makes the image pulsate to the beat of the song
**Repeat** | Repeats the image horizontally to fill the canvas
**Warp** | Applies a 3D "warp" effect to the background image
**Warp Drive** | Animated *Warp* effect
**Wormhole** | *Warp Drive* effect with additional rotation
**Zoom In** | Image is initially centered on the canvas and slowly zooms in as the song plays
**Zoom Out** | Image is initially enlarged at 200% and slowly zooms out as the song plays

You can cycle through the available options using the **Shift + B** keyboard shortcut.

Effects can be selectively disabled in [Config - Background Image Fit options](#configuration).

!> The **Warp Drive** and **Wormhole** effects may degrade performance on some graphics cards.

### Background Dim

<div class="settings-panel highlight-background-dim"></div>

Adjusts the brightness of images and videos shown in the background of the spectrum analyzer.

**By default, Background Dim is disabled when playing a video track or displaying subtitles.** This behavior can be configured in [Config - General settings](#general-settings).

### Reflex

<div class="settings-panel highlight-reflex"></div>

Selects a vertical reflection effect. On [bands modes](#analyzer-mode), this setting has no effect when the [LUMI](#switches) switch is active.

| Reflex: On | Reflex: Mirrored |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| ![reflex-on](img/reflex-on.png) | ![reflex-mirrored](img/reflex-mirrored.png)

### Mirror

<div class="settings-panel highlight-mirror"></div>

Selects a horizontal mirroring effect to the left (low frequencies at the center) or to the right (high frequencies at the center).

| Mirror: Left | Mirror: Right |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| ![mirror-left](img/mirror-left.png) | ![mirror-right](img/mirror-right.png)

### Frequency Range

<div class="settings-panel highlight-frequency-range"></div>

The lowest and highest frequencies represented in the spectrum analyzer. You can use this feature to "zoom in" a specific frequency range.

### Frequency Scale

<div class="settings-panel highlight-frequency-scale"></div>

| Scale    | Description | Frequency distribution preview (10Hz - 24kHz range)
|----------|-------------|-----------------------------------
| **BARK** | Bark scale | ![scale-bark](img/scale-bark.png)
| **LIN**  | Linear scale | ![scale-linear](img/scale-linear.png)
| **LOG**  | Logarithmic scale | ![scale-log-ansi](img/scale-log-ansi.png)
| **MEL**  | Mel scale | ![scale-mel](img/scale-mel.png)

Logarithmic scale allows the visualization of proper **octave bands** (see [Analyzer Mode](#analyzer-mode)) and it's also recommended when using the [**NOTES**](#switches) switch.

[*Bark*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark_scale) and [*Mel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_scale) are perceptual pitch scales, which may provide better visualization of mid-range frequencies, when compared to log or linear scales.

### Sensitivity

<div class="settings-panel highlight-sensitivity"></div>

Adjusts the analyzer sensitivity to improve the visualization of songs too quiet or too loud. You can also use the **N** and **Shift + N** keyboard shortcuts.

Presets for low, normal and high sensitivity can be customized in **[Config - Sensitivity presets](#sensitivity-presets).**

### Weighting

<div class="settings-panel highlight-weighting"></div>

[Weighting filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighting_filter) applied to frequency data for spectrum visualization.

Each filter applies a different curve of gain/attenuation to specific frequency ranges, but the general idea is to adjust the
visualization of frequencies to which the human ear is more or less sensitive.

![weighting-filters-curves](img/weighting-filters-curves.png)

?> Weighting filters **do NOT** affect audio output. Some filters may impact performance, due to increased real-time data processing.

### Channel Layout

<div class="settings-panel highlight-channel-layout"></div>

Selects single or dual channel display, with different layout options:

| Channel Layout | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **SINGL** | Single channel analyzer, representing the combined output of both left and right channels.
| **COMB**  | Dual channel analyzer, both channels overlaid. Works best with [**Line Graph** mode](#analyzer-mode) or [**OUTLINE**](#switches) switch on.
| **HORIZ** | Dual channel, side by side - see [Mirror](#mirror) for additional layout options.
| **VERT**  | Dual channel, left channel at the top half of the canvas and right channel at the bottom.

The channel layout setting does NOT affect stereo audio output.

### Switches

<div class="settings-panel highlight-switches"></div>

Switches toggle additional effects and alternative measurement, informational and performance features.

| Switch    | Description | Switch    | Description |
|:----------|:------------|:----------|:------------|
**INFO**    | Toggle on-screen display of song information on every track change | **SUBTITLES** | Toggle display of [subtitles](#subtitles)

Uncheck options to remove them from the [Background Image Fit](#background-image-fit) selection box.

### General settings

<img src="img/config-general-settings.png" class="img-right">

#### Background media source

Choose the source for [Background](#background) images and videos, or disable this feature.

When set to *Local folder*, only files in the selected folder will be loaded (subfolders are ignored).
Requires browser support for the [*File System Access API*](known-issues.md).

#### Background media max items

Choose the maximum number of media files that can be directly selected in the [Background](#background) setting.

If your backgrounds folder contains more files, the remaining ones will only be selectable via the *Random image* or *Random video* options.

#### FFT size

Number of samples used for the [Fast Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) performed by the analyzer.

Higher values provide greater detail in the frequency domain (especially for low frequencies), but less detail in the time domain (slower response to changes).
The default value of **8192** usually provides the best cost/benefit ratio for both domains.

#### FFT smoothing over time

Averaging factor used to smooth FFT data between analysis frames.

Lower values make the analyzer react faster to changes, and may look better with faster tempo songs and/or larger FFT sizes.
Increase it if the analyzer animation looks too "jumpy".

#### Fullscreen height (%)

Height of the analyzer when in fullscreen. This can be used to provide a wider look to the fullscreen analyzer.

You can also use the **Shift** + **Up** and **Down** arrows to adjust the analyzer height during fullscreen visualization.

#### Maximum frame rate (FPS)

Maximum desired animation frame rate, in frames per second.

*'Unlimited'* will try to match your monitor's refresh rate, but may increase CPU usage.

#### On-screen display font size

Base font size used for information displayed on canvas.

#### PIP aspect ratio

Choose the aspect ratio of the Picture-In-Picture window.

After entering PIP, the window can be resized and the selected aspect ratio will be preserved.

#### Auto-hide media panel on analyzer hover

Automatically hides the [Media Panel](#media-panel) when you move the mouse cursor over the analyzer area.

Move the cursor to the bottom of the window, or click the [**Settings** button](#top-panel-buttons) to show the panel again.

#### Disable Background Dim when playing video

#### Peak fade time

Time in milliseconds for peaks to completely fade out, when [**FADE** switch](#switches) is active.

#### Peak hold time

Time in milliseconds for peaks to hold their values before they start falling down or fading out.

### Randomize configuration

![config-randomize-settings](img/config-randomize-settings.png)

Select which configuration settings may be changed by [Randomize](#randomize).

When **User Presets** is checked, Randomize will first load one of your [saved custom presets](#load-and-save-presets) and then choose random values for any other settings checked.
So if you want to randomize only among your custom presets, uncheck everything else!

### Sensitivity presets

![config-sensitivity-presets](img/config-sensitivity-presets.png)

Customize low, normal and high [Sensitivity](#sensitivity) presets.

**Min dB** and **Max dB** represent the lowest and highest volume levels to be registered by the analyzer, in decibels.

The **Linear boost** value is used to perform an *n*th-root operation to amplify low energy values, when using the linear amplitude scale (see [LINEAR](#switches) switch).

?> Please note that **0** dB represents the loudest volume possible.
