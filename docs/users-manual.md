## Settings Panel

### Load and Save Presets

<div class="settings-panel highlight-preset"></div>

audioMotion comes with 6 built-in presets that showcase different features of the analyzer, plus 9 slots for user-defined presets.

Click the **Load** button to load a preset. User-defined presets can also be loaded by pressing the numbers **1** to **9** in the keyboard.
You can also quickly select random settings by pressing **0** in the keyboard.

The **Demo** preset will pick new visualization settings when loaded and will set [**Randomize**](#randomize) to 15 seconds, so it's a great way to quickly overview all of audioMotion's features!

Your last configuration will be automatically restored the next time you open audioMotion.
You can manually load the **Last session** preset to undo any changes made during the current session.

The **Restore defaults** preset resets all options to their initial values, as in the first time you run audioMotion.

Click the **Save / Edit** button to save, update or delete a favorite configuration in one of the user-defined slots.
Presets can also be saved to a slot by holding **Shift** and pressing the numbers **1** to **9** in the keyboard.

### Randomize

<div class="settings-panel highlight-randomize"></div>

Selects random visualization settings on track change or time interval.

You can choose [which settings](#settings-affected-by-randomize) may be changed by Randomize in the [Config panel](#config-panel).

### Bar spacing

<div class="settings-panel highlight-bar-spacing"></div>

This setting is effective only when an [octave bands mode](#analyzer-mode) is selected. Avaliable options are:

| Bar Spacing | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
**Legacy** | ~1px spacing between analyzer bars
**Narrow** | 10% spacing, 90% bar width (default)
**Regular** | 25% spacing, 75% bar width
**Wide** | 50% spacing, 50% bar width
**Extra wide** | 75% spacing, 25% bar width

### Line Width and Fill Opacity

<div class="settings-panel highlight-line-width-fill-opacity"></div>

These settings are effective only for [Line graph mode](#analyzer-mode) or when [OUTLINE](#switches) switch is on.

**Line Width** controls the thickness of the graph line or outline stroke.

**Fill Opacity** adjusts the transparency of the graph area or bar fill. The [ALPHA](#switches) switch, when active, has precedence over the Fill Opacity (for octave bands modes only).

!> On **Firefox**, Fill Opacity may not work properly with [Radial](#switches) analyzer, due to [this bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1164912).

### Analyzer Mode

<div class="settings-panel highlight-mode"></div>

Selects the visualization mode.

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Discrete frequencies** | Displays amplitudes of individual frequencies, as provided by the [FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) computation
| **Area graph** | Uses the discrete frequency data points to create a filled area graph
| **Line graph** | Connects all the discrete data points in a continuous line graph - [line width and fill opacity](#line-width-and-fill-opacity) can be customized
| **Bands** | Frequencies are grouped in bands. When [Frequency Scale](#frequency-scale) is set to **LOG**, each bar represents the *n*th part of an octave

You can also select the visualization mode using the **M** and **Shift + M** keyboard shortcuts.

### Gradients

<div class="settings-panel highlight-gradients"></div>

Select the color gradients used for the analyzer graphs. You can also change gradients using the **G** and **Shift + G** keyboard shortcuts.

You can disable specific gradients and **create your own gradients** in the [Config panel](#config-panel).

The **LINK** and **SPLIT** switches control some specific features when using a dual [Channel Layout](#channel-layout):

| Switch    | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| **LINK**  | Uses the same gradient for both analyzer channels
| **SPLIT** | Splits the gradient between both channels, so each channel will have different colors (VERT channel layout only)

### Color Mode

<div class="settings-panel highlight-color-mode"></div>

Selects the desired mode for coloring the analyzer bars. This property has no effect in **Area Graph** and **Line Graph** [modes](#analyzer-mode).

| Color Mode | Description | Preview ('prism' gradient)
|------------|-------------|----------------------------
| GRADIENT   | Analyzer bars are painted with the currently selected [Gradients](#gradients). | ![prism](img/gradient-prism.png)
| INDEX      | Each analyzer bar is painted with a **single color** from the selected gradients, starting with the first color applied to the first bar, and so on, cycling through the available colors. | ![prism-bar-index](img/gradient-prism-bar-index.png)
| LEVEL      | Colors from the selected gradient are used to paint each bar, according to its current level (amplitude). | ![prism-bar-level](img/gradient-prism-bar-level.png)

### Radial Spin

<div class="settings-panel highlight-radial-spin"></div>

Configure the radial analyzer spinning speed, when [RADIAL](#switches) switch is on.


### Background

<div class="settings-panel highlight-background"></div>

Selects the analyzer background.

| Background | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Gradient default** | Uses the background color defined by the currently selected gradient - when the [LED switch](#switches) is on, this shows the "unlit" LEDs instead |
| **Black** | Uses a black background |
| **Album cover** | Displays the album cover for the current song<sup> (1)</sup> |
| **Random image** | Selects a random image from the backgrounds folder<sup> (2)</sup> |
| **Random video** | Selects a random video from the backgrounds folder<sup> (2)</sup> |

<sup>**( 1 )**</sup> Album covers will be preferably retrieved from song metadata. When a picture is not found in the metadata, **audioMotion** will look for image files (jpg, png, gif, webp, avif or bmp)
in the song's folder, and will pick any image which filename contains the words *cover*, *folder* or *front* (in this order), or the first image found otherwise.

<sup>**( 2 )**</sup> If you use the `-b` option when [starting **audioMotion**](/#getting-started), image and video files in the provided folder
can also be used as background. All media files found in the first level folder (no subfolders) can be selected by the *Random image* or *Random video* options,
and the first 20 files will also be directly available in the selection box.

See also [Background Image Fit](#background-image-fit) and [Background Dim](#background-dim) settings for additional options for background images and videos.

You can cycle through the available options using the **B** keyboard shortcut.

### Background Image Fit

<div class="settings-panel highlight-bgimagefit"></div>

When [Background](#background) is set to **Album cover** or an image, this option selects the size and positioning of the background image.

| Background Image Fit | Effect |
|----------------------|--------|
**Adjust** | Resizes the image so it fills the entire canvas
**Center** | Displays the image horizontally centered on the canvas (default)
**Pulse** | Makes the image pulsate to the beat of the song
**Repeat** | Repeats the image horizontally to fill the canvas
**Warp** | Applies a 3D "warp" effect to the background image
**Warp Drive** | Animated *Warp* effect
**Wormhole** | *Warp Drive* effect with additional rotation
**Zoom In** | Image is initially centered on the canvas and slowly zooms in as the song plays
**Zoom Out** | Image is initially enlarged at 200% and slowly zooms out as the song plays

You can cycle through the available options using the **Shift + B** keyboard shortcut.

Effects can be selectively disabled in the [Config panel](#config-panel).

!> The **Warp Drive** and **Wormhole** effects may degrade performance on some graphics cards.

### Background Dim

<div class="settings-panel highlight-background-dim"></div>

When [Background](#background) is set to an image (including the Album cover) or video, this option adjusts the brightness of the background.

### Reflex

<div class="settings-panel highlight-reflex"></div>

Selects a vertical reflection effect. On [bands modes](#analyzer-mode), this setting has no effect when the [LUMI](#switches) switch is active.

| Reflex: On | Reflex: Mirrored |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| ![reflex-on](img/reflex-on.png) | ![reflex-mirrored](img/reflex-mirrored.png)

### Mirror

<div class="settings-panel highlight-mirror"></div>

Selects a horizontal mirroring effect to the left (low frequencies at the center) or to the right (high frequencies at the center).

| Mirror: Left | Mirror: Right |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| ![mirror-left](img/mirror-left.png) | ![mirror-right](img/mirror-right.png)

### Frequency Range

<div class="settings-panel highlight-frequency-range"></div>

The lowest and highest frequencies represented in the spectrum analyzer. You can use this feature to "zoom in" a specific frequency range.

### Frequency Scale

<div class="settings-panel highlight-frequency-scale"></div>

| Scale    | Description | Frequency distribution preview (10Hz - 24kHz range)
|----------|-------------|-----------------------------------
| **BARK** | Bark scale | ![scale-bark](img/scale-bark.png)
| **LIN**  | Linear scale | ![scale-linear](img/scale-linear.png)
| **LOG**  | Logarithmic scale | ![scale-log-ansi](img/scale-log-ansi.png)
| **MEL**  | Mel scale | ![scale-mel](img/scale-mel.png)

Logarithmic scale allows the visualization of proper **octave bands** (see [Analyzer Mode](#analyzer-mode)) and it's also recommended when using the [**NOTES**](#switches) switch.

[*Bark*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark_scale) and [*Mel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_scale) are perceptual pitch scales, which may provide better visualization of mid-range frequencies, when compared to log or linear scales.

### Sensitivity

<div class="settings-panel highlight-sensitivity"></div>

Adjusts the analyzer sensitivity to improve the visualization of songs too quiet or too loud. You can also use the **N** and **Shift + N** keyboard shortcuts.

Presets for low, normal and high sensitivity can be customized in the [Config panel](#config-panel).

### Weighting

<div class="settings-panel highlight-weighting"></div>

[Weighting filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighting_filter) applied to frequency data for spectrum visualization.

Each filter applies a different curve of gain/attenuation to specific frequency ranges, but the general idea is to adjust the
visualization of frequencies to which the human ear is more or less sensitive.

![weighting-filters-curves](img/weighting-filters-curves.png)

?> Weighting filters **do NOT** affect audio output. Some filters may impact performance, due to increased real-time data processing.

### Channel Layout

<div class="settings-panel highlight-channel-layout"></div>

Selects single or dual channel display, with different layout options:

| Channel Layout | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **SINGL** | Single channel analyzer, representing the combined output of both left and right channels.
| **COMB**  | Dual channel analyzer, both channels overlaid. Works best with [**Line Graph** mode](#analyzer-mode) or [**OUTLINE**](#switches) switch on.
| **HORIZ** | Dual channel, side by side - see [Mirror](#mirror) for additional layout options.
| **VERT**  | Dual channel, left channel at the top half of the canvas and right channel at the bottom.

The channel layout setting does NOT affect stereo audio output.

### Switches

<div class="settings-panel highlight-switches"></div>

## Console

![console](img/console.png)

The console records several useful information, like audio and video settings, configuration changes and error messages.


## Config Panel

Click **Config** in the top panel buttons to open the Config Panel.

![ui-buttons](img/UI_main_buttons.png)

### Enabled Analyzer Modes

![config-enabled-modes](img/config-enabled-modes.png)

Uncheck the visualization modes you don't want to appear in the [Analyzer Mode](#analyzer-mode) selection box.

### Enabled Gradients

![config-enabled-gradients](img/config-enabled-gradients.png)

Uncheck the gradients you don't want to appear in the [Gradients](#gradients) selection box.

### Gradient Editor

Click the **Add Gradient** button to create a new color gradient, or click any custom gradient to edit it.

![gradient-editor](img/gradient-editor.png)

At least two colors are required to create a gradient, but you can add as many colors as you like.
The **offset** must be a number between 0 and 1 - use it to adjust the position of each color inside the gradient.

### Enabled options for Background Image Fit

![config-enabled-bgfit](img/config-enabled-bgfit.png)

Uncheck the options you don't want to appear in the [Background Image Fit](#background-image-fit) selection box.

### Settings affected by Randomize

![config-randomize-settings](img/config-randomize-settings.png)

Select which configuration settings may be changed by [Randomize](#randomize).

When **User Presets** is checked, Randomize will first load one of your [saved custom presets](#load-and-save-presets) and then choose random values for any other settings checked.
So if you want to randomize only among your custom presets, uncheck everything else!

### General settings

![config-general-settings](img/config-general-settings.png)

**FFT Size** is the number of samples used for the [Fast Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) performed by the analyzer.

Higher values provide greater detail in the frequency domain (especially for low frequencies), but less detail in the time domain (slower response to changes).
The default value of **8192** usually provides the best cost/benefit ratio for both domains.

**Smoothing over time** is the averaging factor used to smooth FFT data between analysis frames.

Lower values make the analyzer react faster to changes, and may look better with faster tempo songs and/or larger FFT sizes.
Increase it if the analyzer animation looks too "jumpy".

**PIP window aspect ratio** selects the aspect ratio of the Picture-In-Picture window.
After entering PIP, the window can be resized and the selected aspect ratio will be preserved.

**Fullscreen Height** adjusts the height of the analyzer when in fullscreen. This can be used to provide a wider look to the analyzer.

You can also use the **Shift** + **Up** and **Down** arrows to adjust the analyzer height during fullscreen visualization.

**Maximum frame rate (FPS)** allows you to control the maximum animation frame rate, in frames per second.
'Unlimited' will try to match your monitor's refresh rate, but may result in high CPU usage.

**Show video files** - whether or not to show video files in the file explorer.

**Remember play queue contents** - whether or not to automatically restore the contents of the play queue the next time you open audioMotion.

**Remember last music folder** - whether or not to start the file explorer in the last previously used folder the next time you open audioMotion.

The **Reset to defaults** button will reset all settings in this section to their default values.

### Sensitivity presets

![config-sensitivity-presets](img/config-sensitivity-presets.png)

Customize low, normal and high [Sensitivity](#sensitivity) presets.

**Min dB** and **Max dB** represent the lowest and highest volume levels detected by the analyzer, in decibels.

The **Linear boost** value is used to perform an *n*th-root operation to amplify low energy values, when using the linear amplitude scale (see [LINEAR](#switches) switch).

?> Please note that **0** dB represents the loudest volume possible.

### On-screen information display options

Customize how long song information is displayed on screen, on different events, and toggle display of albums covers and track count.
